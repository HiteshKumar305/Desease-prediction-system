This is a web-based application that predicts the risk of heart stroke using a machine learning model. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the backend is powered by a Python Flask API.

Features
Users input health parameters such as age, average glucose level, BMI, and others.

The backend Flask API processes the input and returns a stroke prediction.

The result is displayed on the webpage.

The Flask API server will run by default at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ../frontend
Open the index.html file in your web browser (double-click or open with browser).

Fill in the form and test the prediction feature.

Note: Make sure the backend server is running so that the frontend can connect to the API.

Deployment
The backend can be deployed on platforms like Heroku, Render, or any cloud hosting provider.

The frontend is a static website and can be deployed on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or similar services.

After deployment, update the frontend code with the production backend API URL.
